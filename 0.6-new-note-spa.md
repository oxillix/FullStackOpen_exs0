	Note left of browser: A function is bound to the form.onsubmit event, <br> that creates  a new note, pushes it to the <br> local notes variable, redraws the notes, <br> and finally sends the note to the server once the form is submitted
    Note left of browser: user writes something in the <br> note text field and clicks submit, <br> which fires the form.onsubmit event
